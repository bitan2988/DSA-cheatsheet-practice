Explanation
Line 1: This algorithm is called Greedy-Iterative-Activity-Selector, because it is first of all a greedy algorithm, and then it is iterative. There's also a recursive version of this greedy algorithm.

A is an array containing the activities.
s is an array containing the start times of the activities in A.
f is an array containing the finish times of the activities in A.
Note that these arrays are indexed starting from 1 up to the length of the corresponding array.

Line 3: Sorts in increasing order of finish times the array of activities A by using the finish times stored in the array f. This operation can be done in O(N*logN) time, using for example merge sort, heap sort, or quick sort algorithms.

Line 4: Creates a set S to store the selected activities, and initialises it with the activity A[1] that has the earliest finish time.

Line 5: Creates a variable k that keeps track of the index of the last selected activity.

Line 9: Starts iterating from the second element of that array A up to its last element.

Lines 10,11: If the start time s[i] of the ith activity (A[i]) is greater or equal to the finish time {f[k] of the last selected activity (A[k]), then A[i] is compatible to the selected activities in the set S, and thus it can be added to S.

Line 12: The index of the last selected activity is updated to the just added activity */
